## 🚀 Quick Start

Create a directory and download the Compose file:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/javdb-cover-bot && cd ~/javdb-cover-bot
curl -Lo docker-compose.yml https://github.com/shuijiao1/JavDB-Cover-Bot/releases/latest/download/docker-compose.yml
```

Create the config file:

```bash
cat > .env <<'EOF_ENV'
BOT_TOKEN=your Telegram Bot Token
ALLOWED_USER_IDS=
SPOILER=true
EOF_ENV
```

Start the bot:

```bash
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
docker compose logs -f
```

> Leave `ALLOWED_USER_IDS` empty for public access, or set comma-separated Telegram numeric IDs to restrict usage.

## 💬 Usage

Send a code directly:

```text
SSIS-001
```

Or use commands:

```text
/av SSIS-001
/jav SSIS-001
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

| Variable | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `BOT_TOKEN` | Telegram Bot Token | Required |
| `ALLOWED_USER_IDS` | Comma-separated Telegram numeric IDs; empty means public | Empty |
| `SPOILER` | Send cover photos with spoiler masking | `true` |
| `TMP_DIR` | Temporary file directory; Compose sets it to `/app/data/tmp` | `./data/tmp` |

## 🛠 Operations

Check status:

```bash
docker compose ps
```

View logs:

```bash
docker compose logs -f
```

Update:

```bash
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```

## 🔐 Privacy

The bot queries public pages on demand and does not require a database. Keep `BOT_TOKEN` private and consider setting `ALLOWED_USER_IDS` for public deployments.
